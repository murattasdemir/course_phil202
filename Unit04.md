**Unit 4: Theory Change and Scientific Progress** <span id="4"></span> 
“In general we look for a new law by the following process.  First we
guess it.  Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what
would be implied if this law that we guessed is right.  Then we compare
the result of the computation to nature, with experiment or experience,
compare it directly with observation, to see if it works.  If it
disagrees with experiment it is wrong.  In that simple statement is the
key to science.” [1]  
    
 *Feynman’s remark reflects the classical view of theory change,
according to which science progresses through a steady stream of
conjecture and refutation.  This is a view popularized by Karl Popper,
and it continues to influence popular conceptions of the scientific
method.  However, the view conflicts with another popular view, first
developed by Thomas Kuhn, according to which science changes in
discontinuous leaps and bounds, with humdrum periods of normal science
punctuated by radical paradigm changes.  Popper’s and Kuhn’s views
represent two of the more popular views of scientific progress.  But
more nuanced accounts, which aim to better attend to the actualities of
scientific inquiry, suggest that these popular views are
oversimplified.*

    in its entirety.  
      
     This chapter, by Karl Popper (an advocate of falsificationism: see
    Unit 3.2.1), propounds upon what many philosophers of science refer
    to as the *classical view of theory change*.  Popper presents this
    view in the opening section of his chapter; in subsequent sections,
    he explains the ways in which this view has implications for
    realistic attitudes toward our scientific theories, understanding
    the history of science, interpretations of quantum physics, and
    understanding of logic and language.  
      
     As you read this chapter, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What is the classical view of theory change (i.e.,
    Popper’s view)?  How does Popper’s falsificationism inform and
    motivate this view of theory change?  How does this view encourage
    us to interpret the history of science?  
      
     Reading this chapter and answering these questions will take
    approximately 2 hours.

     In “The Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions,” a chapter
    from *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, Thomas Kuhn presents
    his influential ideas about scientific revolutions and the
    development of science.  For Kuhn, the occurrence of such
    revolutions undermines the classical view of scientific development,
    by showing that science does not develop smoothly and cumulatively
    from one problem to the next, but instead proceeds in fits and
    starts, jumping from one paradigm to another.  Kuhn’s work remains
    widely influential, not so much among philosophers of science (many
    of whom appreciate Kuhn’s historical work but disagree with the
    philosophical implications he draws from that work), but primarily
    among sociologists of science and cultural critics of science.  
      
     Bird’s article motivates and summarizes Kuhn’s central ideas about
    the development of science, explaining Kuhn’s distinctions between
    *normal science* and *revolutionary science*, his notion of
    *paradigms*, his thesis about the *incommensurability* of theories
    from different paradigms, and his conception of science as
    *puzzle-solving* rather than (as Popper claims) problem-solving. 
    Curtis Brown’s short notes concisely summarize Kuhn’s views about
    the development of science and the notion of incommensurability. 
    Use the notes as a supplement to understanding Kuhn’s chapter and
    Bird’s article.  Read these materials in order to better understand
    Kuhn’s central ideas.  
      
     As you read Kuhn’s chapter, Bird’s article, and Brown’s notes,
    attempt to answer the following questions: What is Kuhn’s view of
    theory change?  How does Kuhn’s view of theory change differ from
    the classical view?  How does this view encourage us to interpret
    the history of science?  What implications, if any, does this view
    have for the rationality of scientific progress?

     One of the primary philosophical repercussions of Kuhn’s work was
    to cast doubt upon the idea that science develops in a rational
    manner: insofar as changes during revolutionary periods of
    scientific development produce new paradigms that are
    incommensurable with older paradigms, it seems that scientific
    developments during revolutionary periods are, if not irrational,
    then at least non-rational.  One response to Kuhn’s work,
    accordingly, was to attempt to accommodate Kuhn’s insights about the
    history of science by modifying the classical view of theory change,
    in order to preserve the idea that science develops in a rational
    manner.  Lakatos’ work was the first influential attempt in this
    vein, and these readings present an overview of Lakatos’ alternative
    view of theory change.  
      
     As you read these materials, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What is Lakatos’ view of theory change?  How does
    Lakatos’ view of theory change differ from the classical view, and
    from Kuhn’s view?  How does this view encourage us to interpret the
    history of science?  What implications, if any, does this view have
    for the rationality of scientific progress?

     Rather than attempt to modify the classical view of theory change

    so on) are impervious to criticism.  This article by Batts and
    Crawford, while offering a review of Laudan’s two major books,
