**Unit 3: Scientific Reasoning** <span id="3"></span> 
“When playing Russian roulette, the fact that the first shot got off
safely is little comfort for the next.” [1]  
  
 *Science allows us to describe, predict, and explain what happens in
the world around us.  Theories, and other representational vehicles, are
central to these tasks.  But how do scientists develop these theories?
 What, if anything, determines that scientists ought to accept a theory
rather than reject it, or accept one theory rather than another?  And
how do scientific theories help us to understand the world in a way that
non-scientific theories do not?  Answering these questions involves
attending to the different methods of inductive reasoning, understanding
the confirmation relation between facts and theories, and identifying
the distinctive features of scientific explanations.  While there are a
variety of philosophical views about these issues, none of the views are
problem-free.  Accordingly, you should adopt an exploratory and critical
attitude toward the content in this unit: first seek to understand each
view, and then seek to understand its limitations.*

     In this selection from *A Survey of Inductive Generalization*, John
    Norton discusses *enumerative induction*, a common method of
    scientific reasoning that purports to warrant inferences from some
    sample (such as an experiment) to a larger population.  Norton
    provides several examples of enumerative inductions that support
    scientific knowledge, traces a partial history of the way in which
    prior logicians understood enumerative induction, and briefly
    discusses some variant forms of enumerative induction.  
      
     As you read, attempt to answer the following questions: What is the
    general pattern of an enumerative induction?  What are some
    significant scientific hypotheses that seem to have been inferred by
    enumerative induction?  What are some ways in which enumerative
    inductions yield hypotheses that “go beyond” their evidential
    basis?  What are some variant forms of enumerative induction, and
    how do they compare to the standard form in terms of their strength
    and reliability?

     In the selection from *A Survey of Inductive Generalization*, John
    Norton discusses *Mill’s methods*, a set of informal rules, first
    proposed by the philosopher John Stuart Mill, which purport to
    warrant inferences about the causes of various phenomena.  Norton
    explains why these methods (or something like them) are important to
    scientific inquiry, provides examples that illustrate each of Mill’s
    methods, and briefly discusses the range of applicability of these
    methods.  The content from Critical Thinking Web supplements
    Norton’s discussion with more examples, visual aids, and some brief
    comments on the limitations of Mill’s methods.

    questions: What are Mill’s methods?  How do Mill’s methods differ
    from enumerative induction?  What are some significant scientific
    hypotheses that seem to have been inferred using Mill’s methods? 
    What are some ways in which inferences that involve Mill’s methods
    yield hypotheses that “go beyond” their evidential basis?

     Forster and Wolfe provide helpful context for understanding the
    significance of Mill and Whewell’s disagreement about the nature of
    inductive inference in science.  They explain how the differing
    conceptions of induction lead to differing interpretations of the
    reasoning Johannes Kepler used to discover Mars’ elliptical orbit,
    argue that the disagreement between Mill and Whewell is not merely
    terminological, and defend the thesis that Whewell’s conception of
    induction is superior to Mill’s.

     John Stuart Mill, in addition to proposing his methods for causal
    inference (Mill’s methods), also maintained that
    induction – understood as enumerative induction – was an important
    component of scientific reasoning.  Writing in response to Mill,
    William Whewell proposed an alternative conception of induction,
    understood as “*a Colligation of Facts by means of an exact and
    appropriate Conception*.”  The primary difference between Whewell’s
    and Mill’s conceptions of induction is that for Whewell, but not for
    Mill, induction unites a set of facts by means of a novel concept,
    so that induction involves invention in addition to generalization. 
    This reading excerpt from Whewell elaborates upon, and provides
    examples to illustrate, this alternative conception of induction.  
      
     As you read, attempt to answer the following questions: What is a
    “colligation of facts”?  What are some significant scientific
    examples of such colligations?  What are some ways in which
    inductions involving a colligation of facts “go beyond” their
    evidential basis?

    entirety.  
      
     In Section 4 of his famous *Enquiry Concerning Human
    Understanding*, Hume develops an argument that has come to be known
    as the *problem of induction*.  Dividing the objects of human reason
    (that is, the statements upon which we rely in our reasoning) into
    two classes, he argues that objects in the first class – relations
    of ideas – can be known by mere thought without the assistance of
    sensory experience, while objects in the second class – matters of
    fact – cannot.  He then proceeds to ask how we come to know objects
    of this second class.  His answer, “by experience,” leads to a
    further question concerning the nature of inferences from
    experience.  For most of Part 1, Hume rejects various proposals
    about the nature of these inferences (nowadays known as inductive
    inferences); and in Part 2, he argues that we have no reason to be
    confident of the results of these inferences.  Attempt to understand
    Hume’s reasoning on your own.  Use Gideon Rosen’s “The Problem of
    Induction” to check the adequacy of your understanding, or to assist
    you in discerning Hume’s argument.  
      
     Attempt to answer the following questions: What is the difference
    between a *matter of fact* and a *relation of ideas*, and what are
    some examples that illustrate this difference?  According to Hume,
    how do we typically form opinions about unobserved matters of fact? 
    According to Hume, why does the way we typically form opinions about
    observed matters of fact fail to give us good reason to believe that
    our opinions are likely to be true?  Why does Hume’s “solution” to
    the problem of induction not entail that we have just as much reason
    to accept scientific beliefs as we have for accepting religious
    beliefs based upon mere faith?

     Instructions: Please read this article, focusing on section V.  
      
     Ask a typical scientist to express their views about the nature of
    science and, more likely than not, you will hear ideas found in Karl
    Popper’s writings.  In this selection, Popper addresses two issues:
    first, the difference between science and pseudo-science (associated
    with what is known as the *demarcation problem*); second, the nature
    of scientific reasoning (associated with what is known as the
    *problem of induction*).  
      
     In Section I of *Science: Conjectures and Refutations*, Popper
    defends *falsificationism*, the thesis that the distinguishing mark
    of scientific knowledge is its ability to be refuted (or
    falsified).  After applying this thesis in Section II to argue that
    astrology, psychoanalysis, and similar theories are not scientific,
    in Section III Popper argues that the problem of induction is a
    pseudo-problem.  
      
     As you read this selection, attempt to answer the following
    questions: Why does Popper maintain that falsifiability
    distinguishes science from pseudo-science?  Why does Popper reject
    Hume’s problem of induction as a pseudo-problem?

     Mayo and Folse elaborate on a thesis about hypothesis testing first
    developed by the French physicist Pierre Duhem.  This thesis, known
    as the *Duhem problem* or the *Quine-Duhem thesis* (after Willard
    Van Orman Quine, a twentieth-century American philosopher who
    popularized Duhem’s objection), constitutes a powerful challenge to
    Popper’s falsificationism.  It thereby undermines Popper’s claim to
    have successfully dismissed David Hume’s problem of induction.

**3.2.3 Bayesianism** <span id="3.2.3"></span>

    Confirmation”](http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/stat/bayes-confirm.php)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please read each essay above in its entirety.  
      
     In light of the problem of induction and the Duhem problem, many
    philosophers of science adopted the view that, even if we have no
    reason for confidence in the results of inductive inferences,
    nonetheless we can have reasons to believe that scientific evidence
    supports some scientific hypotheses better than others.  Attempts to
    understand the nature of this support relation between evidence and
    hypothesis are known as “accounts of confirmation.”  Of these
    accounts of confirmation, Bayesianism is perhaps the most popular. 
    According to Bayesianism, a theorem of the probability calculus –
    known as Bayes’ Theorem – determines how much support evidence
    provides to a hypothesis.  
      
     Read Curtis Brown’s “An Introduction to Bayes’ Theorem” for an
    explanation of the mathematical theorem at the heart of
    Bayesianism.  (To test your understanding, click on the links at the
    top of Brown’s webpage – “Confirmation 1: Marbles” and “Confirmation
    2: ESP” – for some Java-based interactive examples.)  After you are
    comfortable with the meaning of Bayes’ theorem, proceed to the essay
    “Bayesian Confirmation” to read about the Bayesian account of
    confirmation.  
      
     As you read these essays, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What does Bayes’ Theorem say – not just in mathematical
    terms, but in plain language?  What is the Bayesian account of
    confirmation?  How does the Bayesian account of confirmation differ
    from falsificationism?  How does the Bayesian account of
    confirmation explain how we might have reason to believe that
    scientific evidence supports some scientific hypotheses better than
    others?

     Rejecting falsificationism for being too limited in scope to
    account for scientific inference, and Bayesianism for being too
    permissive to capture the nuances of relationships between evidence
    and hypotheses in scientific practice, Deborah Mayo advocates an
    *error-statistical* account of confirmation.  This account requires
    not only that evidence make a hypothesis more likely to be true than
    competing hypotheses, but also that the experimental procedures used
    to obtain that evidence be reliable in assigning that degree of
    likelihood to the hypothesis.  In the book being reviewed, Mayo
    explains some of the details of her account.  The review by Shalizi,
    a professional physicist, summarizes and contextualizes Mayo’s
    error-statistical account, giving examples to illustrate some
    technical ideas and situating Mayo’s account within the history of
    philosophy of science.  
      
     As you read this material, attempt to answer the following
    questions: Why does Mayo maintain that Bayesianism is too permissive
    to capture the nuances of relationships between evidence and
    hypotheses in scientific practice?  What is the error-statistical
    account of confirmation?  How does this account differ from both
    falsificationism and Bayesianism?  How does the error-statistical
    account of confirmation explain how we might have reason to believe
    that scientific evidence supports some scientific hypotheses better
    than others?

     Clark Glymour generalizes Mill’s methods into a “bootstrap” account
    of confirmation that allows theories to be used in interpreting the
    evidence that is supposed to confirm them.  Norton’s chapter
    summarizes and illustrates this account, explaining the technical
    details of Glymour’s formal definitions with informal prose and
    appealing to some famous arguments by Newton (among others) to show
    how to apply Glymour’s account.

    questions: What is the bootstrap account of confirmation?  How does
    it differ from Bayesianism?  How does it differ from simple

    hypotheses that seem to have been inferred by enumerative
    induction?  Why is the “circularity” involved in bootstrap

     This entry presents the “raven’s paradox.”  First proposed by Carl
    Hempel, this paradox purports to show that any evidence that does
    not falsify a hypothesis confirms that hypothesis.  The paradox
    presents a challenge to accounts of confirmation: either show why
    the reasoning that leads to the “paradox” is mistaken, or else
    explain away the paradox by showing that the conclusion of the
    reasoning is not as counterintuitive as it seems to be.  Proposals
    to meet this challenge are known as “solutions” to the raven’s
    paradox.

**3.3.1 Deductive-Nomological Account** <span id="3.3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: California Polytechnic State University: Carl G. Hempel’s
    “Studies in the Logic of Explanation”**
    Link: California Polytechnic State University: Carl G. Hempel’s
    [“Studies in the Logic of
    Explanation”](http://cla.calpoly.edu/~fotoole/321.1/hempel.html)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the essay in
    its entirety.  
        
     While accounts of *confirmation* address the way in which evidence
    about natural phenomena bear upon hypotheses about those phenomena,
    accounts of *explanation* address the way in which hypotheses about
    natural phenomena bear upon those phenomena.  That is, while
    accounts of confirmation attempt to explicate the notion of
    *support* (the way in which evidence supports hypotheses), accounts
    of explanation attempt to explicate the notion of *explanation* (the
    way in which hypotheses explain phenomena).  Carl Hempel was the
    first contemporary philosopher of science to offer a comprehensive
    and detailed account of scientific explanation.  This account
    applies to explanations of particular events as well as explanations
    of general laws; and it applies to explanations from disciplines as
    diverse as physics, biology, psychology, economics, sociology, and
    linguistics.  
        
     According to Hempel, while scientific descriptions answer the
    question “what?”, scientific explanations answer the question
    “why?”  And the way they answer this question, according to Hempel,
    is by *subsuming* the target of the explanation under a general law,
    such that a statement of the law, together with other true
    statements of other auxiliary hypotheses, deductively entails a
    description of the explanation’s target.  Because deductions and
    laws (Greek: *nomos*) are central to Hempel’s account, it is known
    as the deductive-nomological account of explanation.  Hempel’s essay
    offers examples that motivate and illustrate how this account works,
    addresses objections to the effect that the account does not apply
    to explanations of purposive behavior, considers and rejects
    alternative accounts of explanation that appeal to familiarity or a
    sense of understanding, and offers an analysis of the
    characteristics of lawlike statements.  
        
     As you read this chapter, attempt to answer the following question:
    What, according to Hempel, is the proper way to reconstruct
    scientists’ answers to “why” questions?  What are some examples of
    explanations that fit Hempel’s account of explanation?  What is the
    scope of Hempel’s account – that is, to what explanations in which
    disciplines does his account apply?  
        
     Reading this chapter and answering these questions will take
    approximately 1.5 hours.

     One prominent reaction to the problems that beset Hempel’s
    deductive-nomological account of explanation involves rejecting a
    fundamental presupposition of that account—namely, the idea that
    explanations of phenomena provide information sufficient for
    prediction of those phenomena.  The philosopher of science Wesley
    Salmon pursued this strategy by proposing, instead, that
    explanations need only provide information that makes phenomena more
    likely to occur than not.  Because information about causal
    relations between events turns out to be extremely important
    according to this proposal, Salmon’s view is a kind of causal
    account of explanation.  (David Lewis, another philosopher, offered
    a similar account, but Salmon’s came first and has been discussed
    more by philosophers of science.)  
      
     Part I of this series of lectures motivates Salmon’s approach to
    explanation and summarizes Salmon’s reasons for supposing that
    explanations must involve causal information.  Part II provides some
    of the technical details of Salmon’s causal account, explaining the
    notions of *statistical relevance*, *causal process*, and *causal
    interaction* mentioned in Part I.  When reading Part II, recall the
    ideas about probability from the subunit on Bayesianism: you should
    read notation like “Pr(E|C)” and “Pr(C)” as, respectively, “the
    probability of E given C” and “the probability of C.”  Part III
    turns a critical eye toward Salmon’s account, contrasting Salmon’s
    account with Hempel’s while also presenting some problems with the
    details of Salmon’s account.  Finally, “Problems with the Causal
    Theory of Explanation” presents and illustrates some problems
    concerning the range of applicability of causal accounts of
    explanation.  
      
     As you read these notes, attempt to answer the following questions:
    What is the causal account of explanation?  What problems for
    Hempel’s account of explanation does the causal account aim to
    avoid?  How does it avoid these problems?  What are some examples of
    explanations that fit the causal account of explanation?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read Section 5, “A
    Unificationist Account of Explanation,” in its entirety.  
      
     Given the problems that beset causal accounts of explanation, and
    the lingering difficulties with deductive-nomological accounts of
    explanation, some philosophers of science developed yet a third kind
    of account of explanation.  These accounts focus on the idea that
    explanations unify a wide array of phenomena that, apart from the
    unifying explanation, would have been thought to be unrelated. 
    Woodward’s encyclopedia entry on these unificationist accounts of
    explanation elaborates upon this basic idea, illustrates the account
    and the account’s solutions to the problems with the
    deductive-nomological account, and briefly discusses the relation
    between causal and unificationist accounts of explanation.  The
    entry then turns to a brief survey of the key criticisms of the
    unificationist account.  
      
     As you read this entry, attempt to answer the following questions:
    What is the unification account of explanation?  What problems for
    Hempel’s account of explanation does the unification account aim to
    avoid?  How does it avoid these problems?  What are some examples of
    explanations that fit the unification account of explanation?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the notes in
    their entirety.  
      
     These short lecture notes summarize the central ideas of the
    pragmatic account of explanation and contrast this account with
    causal accounts of explanation.  The notes mention, but do not
    elaborate upon, the “Tower example.”  This refers to the short story
    by Bas van Fraassen (an advocate of the pragmatic account) that
    appears in Chapter 5, “The Pragmatics of Explanation,” of his *The
    Scientific Image*.  The story, briefly, motivates a situation in
    which the answer to “Why is the tower so high?” is “Because the
    shadow needed to be so long.”  The story is meant to be relevant to
    the problem of asymmetry that besets the deductive-nomological
    account of explanation, according to which the height of a tower can
    explain the length of the shadow it casts, but the length of the
    shadow cannot explain the height of the tower.
