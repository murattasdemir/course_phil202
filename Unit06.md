**Unit 6: Social Dimensions of Scientific Practice** <span
id="6"></span> 
“Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.” [1]  
  
 *Science is not some abstract idea.  It is a social institution, with
research organized and conducted by people.  Apart from their special
training and specialized education, scientists are no different from
other people.  They have similar biases and prejudices, similar hopes
and dreams, similar ambitions and desires.  To what extent does the
human element of scientific inquiry impact the products of that inquiry?
 Does science warrant the authority that many ascribe to it?  Is science
biased toward males and male concerns?  Does government sponsorship of
scientific research compromise science’s objectivity?  How ought
scientists respond to the demands and agendas of politicians?  Should
political concerns contribute to the direction of scientific inquiry?
 This concluding unit for the course surveys some of the principal
philosophical replies to these questions about the social dimensions of
scientific practice, supplementing the largely epistemological focus of
the other course units with attention to ethical and political issues.*

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the review in
    its entirety.  
      
     This essay reviews Richard Whitley’s classic text *The Intellectual
    and Social Organization of Science*.  Rather than understand
    scientists as motivated entirely by a lofty goal such as *pursuing
    the truth* or *understanding nature*, Whitley’s work focuses on more
    prosaic motivations, such as *publishing a paper* and *having a good
    professional reputation*.  This orientation leads Whitley to focus
    on the social institutions and organizational structures that
    support scientific inquiry, the professional nature of scientific
    research, and the ways in which scientific disciplines differ from
    one another as a result of these features.  While the review does
    not provide many of the details in Whitley’s text, it offers a good
    overview of the basic ideas.  
      
     As you read the material, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What distinguishes the modern sciences?  What social
    developments permit the existence of science in its modern form? 
    How does academic science differ from state or industrial science? 
    What is the degree of functional dependence of a scientific
    discipline, and the degree of strategic dependence?  What factors
    affect these degrees of dependence?  What is the difference between
    technical task uncertainty and strategic task uncertainty?  What
    factors affect these differences?  How do these concepts—functional
    dependence, strategic dependence, technical and strategic task
    uncertainty – yield a typology of the modern sciences?  
      
     Reading this review and answering these questions will take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

     These materials present further information about the way in which
    the social organization of the academic sciences differentially
    affects men and women, and they engage with the issue of whether
    these differential affects are due to facts about the intrinsic
    differences between genders or, instead, contingent facts about the
    social organization of the science disciplines themselves.  The
    encyclopedia article also discusses the implications of the
    resolution of this issue.  
      
     As you read these materials, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What are some of the ways in which the social
    organization of the sciences differentially affects men and women? 
    What is the evidence in favor of the view that the best explanation
    of these differences concerns entrenched practices in the system of
    academic sciences rather than intrinsic differences between men and
    women?  What are some implications of this explanation?

    essay focuses on the way in which the statutory authority of
    government often overrides the epistemic authority of science. 
    Kitcher’s essay, although a review of some books about climate
    science, also offers some reflections on the appropriate relation
    between scientific and political authority in a democratic
    society.  
      
     As you read these essays, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What are some examples of policy advice that scientists
    have given to politicians?  How was that advice received in each
    case?  Why, according to Marburger, is scientific authority inferior
    to statutory authority in a democratic context?  How, according to
    Kitcher, *ought* policy-makers treat scientific advice in a
    democratic society?

    chapter in its entirety.  Use the navigation buttons (“next”) at the
    bottom of the page to advance the pages.  
      
     Longino’s chapter examines whether and, if so, how social and
    pragmatic values – values that concern social relations and social
    utilities – can be good for scientific inquiry.  She discusses the
    attraction of the ideal of science as “value-free,” the
    underdetermination problem (refer to subunit 5.2.1), competing
    conceptions of scientific knowledge, and the implications of
    value-laden science for rationality, universality, and
    objectivity.  
      
     As you read this chapter, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What is the ideal of value-free science?  Why, according
    to Longino, is the lesson of the underdetermination problem that
    there is a legitimate role for social values in science?  How does
    incorporating social values into science resolve the
    underdetermination problem?  What are some consequences of
    acknowledging the social dimensions of cognitive practices in
    science?  Why, according to Longino, does the presence of social
    values in scientific practice not undermine the cognitive
    rationality of that practice?  How does the presence of social
    values in science affect the ideals of universality and objectivity
    in scientific inquiry?  
      
     Reading this chapter and answering these questions will take

     Douglas’ chapter focuses on the role of science in policy making,
    sketching a brief history of the relation between scientists and
    policy-makers and arguing that there is not (and should not be) a
    clear boundary between science and politics.  
      
     As you read her chapter, attempt to answer the following questions:
    What are some examples of successful scientific advice for policy
    making after World War II?  How do attitudes toward this advice
    differ in different time periods (1945-1965, 1965-1980, 1980-2000),
    and how do views about the role of values in science and policy
    inform these different attitudes?  Why, according to Douglas, have
    attempts to draw a sharp boundary between science and policy
    failed?  What problems arise for the view that, even if value
    judgments have a legitimate role in science, scientists should not
    be the ones who make those judgments?  Why, according to Douglas,
    should science intended for use in policy making *not* be
    value-free?

     Weingart’s chapter explores the issue of why, despite the
    ever-increasing reliance of politics on science, and the increasing
    expectation that science offers reliable knowledge, there is a
    gradual decrease in the epistemic authority of science. 
    Yankelovich’s essay discusses some social implications of, and
    suggestions for overcoming, this decrease in authority.  
      
     As you read this material, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What are the four types of interchange between scientific
    knowledge and social application?  What are some of the
    institutional changes responsible for the attitude that scientific
    knowledge has become unduly “diluted” by values?  How do these
    changes explain the gradual decrease in science’s epistemic
    authority?  What are some symptoms of this decrease in authority?  
      
     Reading these materials and answering these questions will take
    approximately 2 hours.
