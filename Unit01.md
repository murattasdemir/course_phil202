**Unit 1: What Is Philosophy of Science?** <span id="1"></span> 
“Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology
is to
birds.” [1][](file:///D:/Documents/Saylor/Google%20Drive/Course%20Development/Philosophy/PHIL202/PHIL202-FLC-FINAL-LINKS-FINAL.doc#_ftn1)  
  
 *Of all the intellectual disciplines, the sciences make the strongest
claims to provide us with knowledge of the way the world is.  But how
does science work?  What do scientists do that makes their research
particularly worthy of our attention?  Why do they pursue some inquiries
rather than others?  And does science really live up to its claims to
provide us with objective and rational knowledge?  Answering these
questions involves attention to scientific practice and the results of
scientific research, as well as familiarity with past and present
episodes of scientific inquiry.  But beyond such sociological and
historical information, answering these questions requires subsuming the
myriad details of scientific research and practice under general
concepts and judging them in light of evaluative norms.  These further
tasks fall within the province of the philosophy of science.*

     Nobel prize-winning physicist and popular science writer Richard
    Feynman offers his opinions about how scientists discover new laws
    and identifies the characteristics that distinguish science from
    non-science.  What are Feynman’s ideas on the distinctive features
    of the scientific method?  Write his opinions down for reference, in
    order to compare and assess his ideas with claims made by
    philosophers of science in later units.

     Physicist David Deutsch presents his thoughts on the nature and
    power of scientific investigation, as well as on the distinction
    between mythical and scientific thinking.  He relies, in part, on
    ideas from the philosopher Karl Popper (whom you will study later in
    this course).  Deutsch touches upon several topics you will learn
    about in this course: the theory-ladenness of observation, the
    significance of testability, the nature of explanation, and theory
    choice.  What are Deutsch’s opinions on these topics?  Write his
    opinions down for reference, in order to compare his ideas with
    claims made by philosophers of science in later units.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the entire
    article.  
      
     With his version of the scientific method, mathematician Mike Adler
    represents a common opinion of scientists toward philosophy.  What
    reasons does Adler give for supposing that philosophy is not a
    reliable method for gaining access to truths about the world?  Why
    does he think science offers a better method?  
      
     Reading this article and answering these questions should take
    approximately 1 hour.

    Thing”**

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the entire
    article.  
      
     Philosopher Alva Noë identifies certain problems that, in his
    opinion, scientists are not in a position to solve by doing
    science.  He also identifies certain philosophical ideas that some
    scientists take for granted without realizing their complexity. 
    What are some distinctively philosophical problems, prompted by
    science, that Noë identifies?  What are the philosophical ideas that
    he believes certain scientists have uncritically adopted?  Finally,
    relate Noë’s opinions about the relation of science and philosophy
    to Adler’s opinions in the previous reading.  
      
     Reading this article and answering these questions should take
    approximately 1 hour.
