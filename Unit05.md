**Unit 5: Interpretations of Scientific Knowledge** <span
id="5"></span> 
“Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but
that’s not why we do it.” [1]  
    
 *Science seems to be our best guide to determining the way the world
is.  But does the real world actually contain atoms or genes, for
example, or is a literal interpretation of our scientific theories
unwarranted?  Instrumentalism about science is the view that science
aims only to develop effective instruments for prediction and control of
nature.  Scientific realism, in contrast, is the view that science aims
to discover the truth about the world and that we have good reason to
believe that our current theories are at least approximately true.  If
realism is correct, a literal interpretation of our best available
theories is warranted.  However, the underdetermination of theory by
evidence, and science’s historical track record of failure, suggest that
realism is overly optimistic.  Alternative interpretations of scientific
knowledge diverge on the extent to which we ought to believe that the
world is the way our scientific theories represent it as being.*

    Argument’ for Scientific Realism”; and Stanford Encyclopedia of
    Philosophy: Anjan Chakravartty’s “The Miracle Argument”**

    Argument’ for Scientific
    Realism”](http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/article020108.html)

    Chakravartty’s [“The Miracle
    Argument”](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/#MirArg)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the first link above and read the
    article in its entirety.  Focus especially on the introduction as
    well as the sections titled “Inference to the Best Explanation” and
    “The Miracle Argument.”  
      
     Please click on the second link above and read Section 2.1 of
    Chakravartty’s entry in its entirety.  
      
     These readings present one of the standard arguments in favor of
    scientific realism: the so-called “miracle argument.”  In his essay,
    Musgrave explains the kind of inference upon which this argument
    relies (*inference to the best explanation*), presents the argument
    itself, and offers his assessment of whether the argument succeeds. 
    His exposition of the argument invokes the notion of *empirical
    adequacy*: a theory is empirically adequate to the extent that it
    makes correct predictions about all observable phenomena (including
    unobserved phenomena, but without regard to the truth or falsity of
    the claims it makes concerning unobservable entities such as quarks
    or DNA).  Chakravartty’s exposition does not invoke this notion;
    however, his exposition is much more concise and does not elaborate
    upon the motivation for the argument.  
      
     As you read, attempt to answer the following questions: What do
    realists mean when they talk about the “success of science”?  Why do
    realists suppose that the “success of science” deserves an
    explanation?  What is an “inference to the best explanation”?  What
    do realists propose as the best explanation of the success of
    science?  How does this differ from alternative proposals, and why
    do realists maintain that their proposal is superior to the
    alternatives?

    Number
    Determined?”](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-was-avogadros-number)

    Bodner’s article in its entirety.  
      
     Please click on the second link above and read Section 2.2 of
    Chakravartty’s entry in its entirety.  
      
     There are roughly twelve different methods for measuring
    *Avogadro’s number* – the number of protons in a gram of pure
    protons.  These methods yield remarkably similar results, and this
    agreement – or corroboration among methods – motivates a different
    argument for scientific realism.  Bodner briefly discusses some of
    the methods for determining Avogadro’s number, and Chakravartty
    briefly presents an argument that takes the kind of corroboration
    exhibited in the measurement of Avogadro’s number to be support for
    scientific realism.  
      
     As you read, attempt to answer the following questions: What are
    some examples of *corroboration* regarding unobservable entities? 
    Why would this corroboration be “an extraordinary coincidence” if
    the unobservable entities did not exist?  How does the argument from
    corroboration differ from the “miracles” argument for scientific
    realism?

    underdetermination is.  
      
     Please click on the second link above and read Section 3.1 of
    Chakravartty’s entry in its entirety.  Focus on understanding the
    significance of underdetermination for scientific realism.  
      
     Some of the preceding readings in this course have mentioned the
    notion of *underdetermination*.  Newall explains this notion in more
    detail.  Chakravartty’s entry provides an exposition of the way in
    which underdetermination presents a challenge to the realist
    interpretation of scientific knowledge.  
      
     As you read this material, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What is underdetermination?  What kinds of
    underdetermination are there?  What are some examples of
    underdetermination from actual science?  How does underdetermination
    constitute an objection to scientific realism, or to arguments for
    scientific realism?

    lecture notes in their entirety.  
      
     Please click on the second link above and read Section 3.3 of
    Chakravartty’s entry in its entirety.  
      
     After summarizing the significance of underdetermination for
    scientific realism, Folse presents a second objection to scientific
    realism popularized by Larry Laudan.  Rather than appealing to
    possibilities regarding alternatives to our current scientific
    theories, this argument—known as the *pessimistic induction*—appeals
    to facts regarding our prior scientific theories.  Chakravartty’s
    entry also briefly presents this argument.  
      
     As you read this material, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What is the argument known as the “pessimistic
    induction”?  In what way is this argument an inductive argument? 
    What evidence, regarding the history of science, is available to
    support (or refute) the premises of this induction?  How does the
    induction constitute an objection to scientific realism, or to
    arguments for scientific realism?

    Realism”](http://www.richmond-philosophy.net/rjp/rjp_back_issues.php)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above.  Scroll down to find
    the heading for “Issue 3 – Spring 2003,” and then click on the link
    that follows “On Scientific Realism” to open a PDF file.  Read the
    article in its entirety.  
      
     Rather than concede their commitment to scientific realism in light
    of objections to their view, some philosophers of science maintain
    that the objections fail to pose a significant challenge to their
    view.  After reviewing the “miracle” argument and the pessimistic
    induction, Cruse argues that the pessimistic induction does not
    refute scientific realism.  
      
     Read this article in order to deepen your understanding of the
    “miracle” argument and the pessimistic induction, as well as to
    deepen your understanding of the way in which scientific realism
    advocates interpreting the history of science and scientific
    knowledge.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the notes in
    their entirety.  
      
     In these lecture notes, Zynda summarizes arguments that favor a
    limited form of realism known as *entity realism*.  This kind of
    realism fits nicely with the argument from corroboration.  
      
     As you read the notes, attempt to answer the following questions:
    What is entity realism?  In what ways does entity realism differ
    from full-blown scientific realism?  What are some arguments in
    favor of entity realism?  How might entity realism avoid some of the
    objections to realism (underdetermination, pessimistic induction)?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the entry in
    its entirety.  
      
     Scientific realists who do not reject the argument from
    underdetermination and the pessimistic induction tend to limit their
    realism in some way.  Entity realism (see prior subunit) offers one
    way to implement this strategy.  Structural realism, the topic of
    Ladyman’s entry, offers another.  
      
     As you read this entry, attempt to answer the following questions:
    What is structural realism?  How does it differ from full-blown
    scientific realism, and from entity realism?  What are some
    arguments in favor of structural realism?  How might structural
    realism avoid some of the objections to realism (underdetermination,
    pessimistic induction)?

    Please click on the third link above and read the section in Kalin’s
    essay labeled “Scientific Instrumentalism.”  
      
     Osiander’s preface to Copernicus’ *On the Revolutions of the
    Heavenly Spheres* is a classic example of an instrumentalist
    interpretation of scientific knowledge, and in particular an
    instrumentalist interpretation of astronomical theory.  Palmer’s
    essay provides historical context for Copernicus’ work and explains
    Osiander’s motivation for his instrumentalist interpretation of that
    work.  Kalin’s essay complements Palmer’s by explaining the basic
    theses of instrumentalism and general reasons instrumentalists offer
    in favor of their view.  
      
     As you read these materials, attempt to answer the following
    questions: What is instrumentalism?  How does instrumentalism differ
    from scientific realism?  What reasons or evidence support or
    motivate instrumentalism?  In what ways does Osiander’s introduction
    to Copernicus’ work exhibit an instrumentalist interpretation of
    astronomical theory?  
      
     Reading these materials and answering these questions will take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

     Please click on the second link above and read Thornton’s notes in
    their entirety.  
      
     Instrumentalists reject the idea that scientific theories aim to
    give us literally true stories about what the world is like.  For
    this reason, it is an anti-realist interpretation of scientific
    knowledge.  But not all anti-realist interpretations reject this
    idea.  One such anti-realism is constructive empiricism.  Monton and
    Mohler’s encyclopedia entry explains the details of this position,
    contrasts it with scientific realism, and summarizes arguments that
    favor constructive empiricism over scientific realism.  Thornton’s
    brief notes concisely summarize one of these arguments and offer a
    very compressed criticism of the constructive empiricist
    interpretation of scientific knowledge.  
      
     As you read these materials, attempt to answer the following
    questions: How does constructive empiricism differ from scientific
    realism?  How does constructive empiricism differ from
    instrumentalism?  What reasons or evidence support or motivate
    constructive empiricism?  How might scientific realists respond to
    these arguments or object to constructive empiricism?

    second link above and read Bloor’s chapter in its entirety.  Please
    click on the third link above and read Alvarez’s article in its
    entirety.  
      
     As Chakravartty explains in his article, one of the outcomes of the
    Kuhnian-inspired focus on history in the philosophy of science was a
    focus on the significance of social factors for the interpretation
    of scientific knowledge.  This focus gave rise to a variety of
    social constructivist interpretations of scientific knowledge. 
    While Chakravartty’s entry sketches the basic ideas of these
    interpretations, the chapter by Bloor is a primary source from one
    of the initial advocates of this interpretative approach.  Alvarez’s
    article, finally, summarizes a partial history of the relationship
    between social constructivism and mainstream philosophy of
    science.  
      
     As you read these materials, attempt to answer the following
    questions: How does social constructivism differ from scientific
    realism, instrumentalism, and constructive empiricism?  What are the
    basic tenets of the sociology of science (as Bloor understands this
    discipline)?  What is the “strong programme” in the sociology of
    scientific knowledge?  What might motivate this programme?  What are
    some objections to this programme, and how might an advocate of the
    programme respond?  What are some specific interpretations of
    scientific knowledge that follow from the strong programme?
