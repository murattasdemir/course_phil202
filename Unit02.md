**Unit 2: Observation, Theory-Ladenness, and Objectivity** <span

“*[U]nless we make default assumptions, the world would simply make no
sense.*  It would be as useless to perceive how things ‘actually look’
as it would be to watch the random dots on untuned television screens.
 What really matters is being able to see what things *look
like*.” [1][](file:///D:/Documents/Saylor/Google%20Drive/Course%20Development/Philosophy/PHIL202/PHIL202-FLC-FINAL-LINKS-FINAL.doc#_ftn1)  
  
 *Observation, whether performed in a natural or an experimental
environment, is one of the key sources of scientific evidence.  Popular
discussions of science often suppose that the information obtained
through observation has a kind of objectivity that information obtained
by faith or personal revelation does not.  But does it?  Some, such as
Carl Hempel, maintain that observational evidence is especially
objective by virtue of being directly and intersubjectively accessible. 
Others, such as Norwood Russell Hanson, argue that background
theoretical assumptions always influence the results of observation, and
that this “theory-ladenness” renders observational evidence irremediably
subjective.  Still others, such as Israel Scheffler, argue that
theory-ladenness does not compromise the objectivity of observational
evidence.*

    Observation Reports Describe?”**

     Instruction: Please click on the above link, which directs you to
    the second section of Bogen’s article “Theory and Observation in
    Science.”  In this section, Bogen summarizes Carl Hempel’s views
    about the nature of observation.  An account of the nature of
    observation does not characterize the physical and mental processes
    involved in observing the world; nor does it characterize the
    methods we use to perform observations.  Instead, an account of the
    nature of observation characterizes what it is that gets observed
    when an observation happens.  Hempel’s account of the nature of
    observation is the background for subsequent philosophical
    discussions regarding the objectivity of observation (discussions
    that you will study in the remainder of this section).  
      
     Hempel provides an indirect account of the nature of observation
    with an account of the nature of observation reports.  An
    “observation report” is a spoken or written sentence that records an
    observation; and since these sentences describe the content of
    observation, we can determine the nature of observation by
    determining what it is that observation reports describe.  Bogen
    summarizes both Hempel’s account of the nature of observation as
    well as Hempel’s criticisms of a competing, phenomenalist account.  
      
     As you read Bogen’s summary, answer the following questions in
    order to verify your understanding of the material: What is the
    phenomenalist account of the nature of observation—that is,
    according to the phenomenalist account, what gets observed when an
    observation happens?  What are some limitations of this account? 
    What is Hempel’s account, and how does his account avoid the
    limitations of the phenomenalist account?  
      
     Reading this selection and answering these questions should take

    1: Observation”**

     Instructions: Please click on the above link and read the entire
    chapter.  
      
     Hanson begins this chapter with a brief discussion of situations in
    which two scientists, present at roughly the same spatiotemporal
    location and attentive to roughly the same objects and events at
    that location, differ in how they characterize the experience. 
    These situations raise the question: Do the scientists have the same
    experience, merely described in different language; or do their
    experiences differ?  
      
     Hanson dismisses phenomenalist-style appeals to mental states and
    sense data to answer this question, according to which scientists
    have the same experiences because they have roughly the same sense
    data; and he dismisses appeals to variations of interpretation,
    according to which the scientists have different interpretations of
    the same experience.  He then defends the thesis that the scientists
    have different experiences, and he locates the source of this
    difference, not in the objects themselves, but rather in the context
    each scientist brings to the object.  In a scientific setting, these
    contexts typically involve theoretical commitments and concepts as
    well as other higher-order forms of knowledge.  These concepts,
    Hanson argues, lead the scientists to organize the elements of their
    experience differently; and so, Hanson concludes, the scientists’
    experiences differ by virtue of being theory-laden.  (“Theory,” in
    this context, is used in a very broad sense to refer not only to
    scientific theories but also to naïve theories, mental models,
    perceptual schemata, and so on.)  
      
     As you read this chapter, attempt to answer the following
    questions: Why does Hanson dismiss appeals to sense data as
    providing an answer to his central question?  Why does he dismiss
    appeals to variations of interpretation?  What does he take the
    various figures that appear in his chapter to show?  Finally, what
    reasons does he provide for the thesis that observation is a
    theory-laden undertaking?  
      
     Reading this chapter and answering these questions should take
    approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Please click on the above link and read the lecture
    notes in their entirety.  
      
     Folse’s lecture notes clarify and elaborate upon some of the
    concepts and positions involved in philosophical discussions of the
    nature of observation: *sense data theory* (also known as
    phenomenalism); *physicalism* (the view Hempel advocates); and
    *theory-ladenness*.  You should focus your reading on understanding
    these ideas.  Later course units will cover, in more detail, other
    ideas from Folse’s lecture notes, such as *confirmation* and *theory
    choice*.  Accordingly, while you should read Folse’s notes in their
    entirety, read with the aim of achieving some clarification of the
    prior readings in this course unit as well as some orientation to
    the significance of discussions about the nature of observation.  
      
     Reading these notes and relating them to prior material will take

     Instructions: Please click on the above link and read the chapter
    in its entirety.  
      
     Scheffler characterizes the ideal of objectivity, explains why
    satisfaction of this ideal is important to the authority of science,
    and discusses challenges to the idea that objectivity in scientific
    inquiry is possible.  Some of these challenges are based upon the
    claim that observation is theory-laden (refer to the previous
    reading from Hanson for details).  Scheffler indicates that he
    suspects these challenges must be mistaken; he does not, however, in
    this chapter, indicate his reasons for rejecting the challenges.  
      
     You should read this chapter with the following questions in mind:
    What is the ideal of objectivity?  Why is satisfaction of this ideal
    important?  How does the thesis of theory-ladenness challenge the
    possibility of satisfying this ideal in scientific inquiry?

**2.3.2 The Compatibility of Theory-Laden Observation and Objectivity**
<span id="2.3.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Digital Text International: Eugene Lashchyk’s “Facts Are
    Paradigm-Laden”**
    Link: Digital Text International: Eugene Lashchyk’s [“Facts Are
    Paradigm-Laden”](http://www.ditext.com/lashchyk/kuhn2b.html)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the above link and read the chapter
    in its entirety.  
      
     In this selection from his book *Scientific Revolutions*, Lashchyk
    addresses two questions: (1) Does the claim that there is no neutral
    observation language imply that there is no independent and
    objective reality that must be taken into account by our scientific
    theories?  (2) Does it imply that there is no independent check on
    the creation of our conceptual schemes?  He answers each question in
    the negative, arguing (contrary to Scheffler’s worries in the
    preceding reading selection) that the theory-ladenness of
    observation does not compromise the objectivity of science.  
      
     Although Lashchyk frames his discussion as a response to Thomas
    Kuhn’s idea that observation is determined by a scientist’s
    paradigm, the discussion is relevant to Hanson’s idea that
    observation is theory-laden.  For Kuhn’s idea (which you will learn
    about in more detail later in this course) is an elaboration of
    Hanson’s idea: *paradigms* include not only theories (in Hanson’s
    sense) but also scientific practices and attitudes.  Accordingly,
    you may take Lashchyk’s argument to be addressing concerns about the
    objectivity of science in light of the theory-ladenness of
    observation.  Focus specifically on the reasons Lashchyk offers for
    maintaining that theory-laden observations can support the rejection
    of current theories and the development of new theories.  (The
    relevant discussion begins just over halfway through Lashchyk’s
    paper.)  
      
     Reading this chapter and relating the content to prior material
    will take approximately 1 hour.
