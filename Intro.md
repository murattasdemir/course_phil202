This course is a survey of philosophical issues surrounding the concepts
and practices of modern science.  The course covers the major areas of
contemporary philosophy of science, including scientific reasoning,
scientific progress, interpretations of scientific knowledge, and the
social organization of scientific practice.  Its aim is not only to
familiarize you with philosophical issues about science but also to
equip you to critically interpret popular reports about contemporary
scientific research. Unit 1 introduces philosophy of science as a
discipline distinct from psychology of science, history of science, and
sociology of science.  Unit 2 examines the nature and objectivity of
observational evidence, and Unit 3 examines methods of reasoning
relevant to induction, confirmation, and explanation.  Unit 4 examines
accounts of theory change and scientific progress, and Unit 5 addresses
the interpretation of scientific knowledge.  Finally, Unit 6 explores
various topics concerning science in a social context. Throughout this
course, you will become acquainted with the views of a number of
influential philosophers of science, including David Hume, Pierre Duhem,
Carl Hempel, Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Bas van Fraassen,
Philip Kitcher, and Helen Longino.  You will read some selections from
scientific research too, by way of news articles and case studies, in
order to connect philosophical views about science to actual scientific
practice.  You should approach the content of this course with an
attitude that is neither hostile toward nor naïve about science, but is
instead critically engaged in trying to understand science as a human
activity.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   identify some questions and tasks that are appropriate to philosophy
    of science;

-   compare different accounts of theory change and scientific progress;
-   compare different interpretations of scientific knowledge;
-   summarize different accounts of the social dimensions of science,
    including theses about the social organization of scientific
    research, the presence and effects of gender biases, the authority
    and objectivity of scientific knowledge, and the relation between
    science and politics;
-   assess a variety of philosophical views about scientific practice
    and scientific knowledge, including views about theory-ladenness and
    the objectivity of observation, scientific reasoning, theory change
    and scientific progress, and interpretations of scientific
    knowledge; and
-   interpret contemporary scientific research (as published, for
    example, in *Scientific American*, *Science*, or *Nature*) using
    philosophical concepts and accounts of science.
